== DSTROSMASH! README v1.0B ==

For original detailed game instructions (taken from the original game's manual),
 please visit the Blue Sky Rangers' (Intellvision Lives!) website:

Compatibility:
    EMULATION:
    Works best with NO$GBA.

    HARDWARE:
    I have only tested 'dstrosmash.nds' on an M3 DS Simply cart, but I believe it
     should work on most any hardware solution (especially anything in the R3 family).

Installation:
    Copy the appropriate image (probably 'dstrosmash.nds' to your cart. There are no 
     interactions with the filesystem, so it doesn't matter where you put it.

CONTROLS:
    SHOOT            - A or B
    MOVE             - DPAD
    HYPER (teleport) - X or Y
    SWAP SCREENS     - L
    PAUSE/CONTINUE   - START

BUGS:
    Sometimes after playing for a long time (10+ minutes, usually) the sound will either
     cut out entirely, or get "stuck" playing an annoying sound (usually the UFO).
     The only workaround is to turn your volume down; rebooting the DS will also solve this.

    IF YOU ENCOUNTER WHAT YOU THINK IS A BUG, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
