For [original detailed game instructions (taken from the original game's manual)](http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/instructions/space/astro.txt),
 please visit the Blue Sky Rangers' (Intellvision Lives!) [website](http://www.intellivisionlives.com/).

##Compatibility:##
###EMULATION:###
Works best with [NO$GBA](http://nocash.emubase.de/gba.htm).

###HARDWARE:###
I have only tested 'dstrosmash.nds' on an M3 DS Simply cart, but I believe it
should work on most any hardware solution (especially anything in the R3 family).

##Installation:##
Copy the appropriate image (probably 'dstrosmash.nds') to your cart. There are no 
interactions with the filesystem, so it doesn't matter where you put it.

##CONTROLS:##
- SHOOT            - `A` or `B`
- MOVE             - `DPAD`
- HYPER (teleport) - `X` or `Y`
- SWAP SCREENS     - `L`
- PAUSE/CONTINUE   - `START`

##BUGS:##
Sometimes after playing for a long time (10+ minutes, usually) the sound will either
cut out entirely, or get "stuck" playing an annoying sound (usually the UFO).
The only workaround is to turn your volume down; rebooting the DS will also solve this.
